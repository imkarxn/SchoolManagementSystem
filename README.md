# SchoolManagementSystem
This program aims to facilitate the process of marking and reviewing attendance
of students under a single faculty. It provides support to faculties by making
attendance marking a quick action.
We aim to have the following use cases in the program:
• Mark Attendance – Use the current Data to determine the current day
(today) and mark their attendance accordingly, (and maybe of previous days
too, if the records are not present)
• View Attendance (Teacher)– View Attendance of Student Lists day wise and also Total attendance of all the days can be seen.
• View Attendance (Student)–Students can individually see their attendance by logging through roll number and password.
• Main page – specifies information about the school such as About us , contact us , vision & mission and admission procedure.
